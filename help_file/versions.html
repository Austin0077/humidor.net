Currently there are actually 5 different builds of this software:

<ul>
<li> v1 - LCD - primary build created in 2014 (/Arduino/humidor)
<li> v2 - Touch - new build, fancy but expensive (Arduino/tft)
<li> low cost - build with no screen or buttons  (Arduino/low_cost)
<li> multi sensor version (Arduino\multi_sensor_version)
<li> Arduino Yun Test  (\Arduino\tests\yun_tft)
</ul>

The v1 LCD ($100) I ran full time for a year solid and has been very stable, especially with the external
watchdog in place. I think I finally found the bug which was causing occasional hangs though so the
external watchdog may no longer be necessary. 
<br><br>

The v2 touch screen version ($160) was just released mid December 2015 and is in long term testing trials now.
It appears to be stable at this point. I will update this in several months.
<br><br>

The low cost build ($40) is pretty much complete, but I need to run long term stability tests on it still.
There is a dedicated readme file in its folder on how to set it up.
<br><br>

The last two are projects I have tinkered with as tests, they should (probably) work but i forget
where i left off on them.
<br><br>

If there is an interest I may also create a build based around the netduino microcontroller.
