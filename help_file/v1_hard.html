this project makes use of 5 main hardware components. Soldering of the components requires about 20 to 30 minutes work.

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/50" target=_blank>Arduino Uno R3 - $24  </a>
<li><a href="https://www.virtuabotix.com/product/virtuabotix-dht22-temperature-humidity-sensor-arduino-microcontroller-circuits/" target=_blank> DHT22 Temperature/Humidity Sensor - $12</a>
<li><a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/772" target=_blank> AdaFruit 16x2 LCD Shield - $20  </a>
<li><a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/1491" target=_blank> AdaFruit Wireless Ethernet Shield - $40 </a> &nbsp; (<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/85" target=_blank>with pass through headers $2</a>)
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012C97ODC" target=_blank>9-12v 1 Amp DC center positive power adapter w/ 2.1mm plug - $6</a> <b>*</b>
</ul>
<br><br>

I have also prepared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM54fs1qsvk&list=UUhIoXVvn4ViA3AL4FJW8Yzw" target=_blank>video walk through of the components</a>

there is actually very little assembly required. The LCD shield is the most complex part, but it only requires basic soldering skills
and following a <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-lcd-shield" target=_blank>very well documented tutorial</a> that includes plenty of pictures. 
Note that you may want to skip soldering in the tiny push buttons. See the enclosure link for more details.
<br><br>

Once the shields are complete, you just plug them directly into each other. There is no way to screw it up.

<br><br>

The temperature sensor, is also very simple and only has three wires that have to be soldered on. The wires this sensor requires
are :
<br><br>

<ul>
<li> 5V <font color=red>(red)</font> , 
<li> digital pin #2 <font color=blue>(blue)</font>, 
<li> GND <font color=green>(green)</font>
</ul>

<br><br>

<br><br>

these are clearly marked on the wifi shield and back of sensor. 

<br><br>

<br><br>

You actually have 3 choices of where to connect the Ground (GND) wire, which is why
3 spots are marked green in the picture. 
<br><br>

You may notice that I clipped the unused lead off of the DHT22 sensor and plugged the hole in the
socket with hot glue. This is so that I can not wire it up backwards which would burn out the sensor.
<br><br>

While all the components may look intimidating, if you have ever installed a car radio, that was more work than this.

<b>*Note: the Wifi card requires allot of power, you will get weird bugs and hangs if you use to small of a power supply
or one of low quality.</b>
