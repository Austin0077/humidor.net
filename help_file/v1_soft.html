<div style="width:600">

now that you have your hardware, and a UserID + API key from the Web server section, now it is time to upload the code to the Arduino.
<br><br>

to do this you will have to download and install <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases" target=_blank>the Arduino software</a>.
I would recommend using a slightly older 1.5.0 or 1.0.x installer, which adafruit recommends for use with the WiFi library.
They have downloads available for windows, Macintosh, and Linux.
<br><br>

Also make sure you have downloaded the <a href="https://github.com/dzzie/humidor.net/archive/master.zip" target=_blank>latest IoT humidor source</a>.
<br><br>

There are only a couple small changes that you have to make to the source code before uploading.
<br><br>

first you must install the Arduino libraries from the folder <b>/Arduino/libraries/</b> to your local /libraries/ folder in the root of your Arduino
installation directory. Literally this is just a copy and paste operation.
<br><br>

Next in the /Arduino/humidor/ folder, rename the file <b>public.h</b> to private.h the public file is a template that will hold your private settings
for connecting to your home Wi-Fi, and your user ID and API key.<a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-cc3000-wifi/cc3000-library-software" target=_blank>This document</A>
will help you set up your Wi-Fi password settings.
<br><br>

you will also have to set your client_id and APIKEY. Examples are provided in the document.
<br><br>

The temp_shift and humi_shift settings can be used to adjust the readings in case your sensor is off a bit when tested against a known good
hygrometer. We will discuss USE_EXT_WATCHDOG setting in the advanced document.
<br><br>

As a final sanity check, look at the top of humidor.ino and make sure that:

#define debug_local  0 

Once these steps are complete you can double click on the humidor.ino file plug in your arduino to your PC with the USB cable, and upload
the code.
<br><br>

Congrats setup is complete and you should see information start to show up on the LCD screen!
