The easiest way to get started is to make use of the free hosting on SandSprite.com, all you have to do
is contact me to get a user ID and API key that you can use. you can email me at
<a href="mailto:dzzie@yahoo.com?subject=IoT%20Account%20Setup&body=Hi%20Please%20create%20an%20account%20for%20me" target=_blank>dzzie@yahoo.com</a>
<br><br>

If you take this option, you can skip all of the information below and go straight on to the <a href=soft.html>software page</a>
<br><br>

if you would like to host your own server on your local network then the easiest way to do it
is to install <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/" target=_blank>Wamp Server</a> which comes with everything you need.
You can also use your own internet hosting provider. If you store your data locally on your own network , then it will not be
available while you are on the road.
<br><br>

once you have a working server to use, then you will need to import the database structure found in the humidor.sql file
from the <a href="https://github.com/dzzie/humidor.net">GIT repository.</a> The default database name is test. You can use the PHP MyAdmin
tool to do this. (It is included with WAMP and most web host control panels)
<br><br>

Depending on your settings, you may need to edit the functions.php web page to match your server. 
There are some variables listed at the top of this document in the public config block:

<pre>
$DB_IP = '127.0.0.1';
$DB_USER = 'root';
$DB_PASS = '';
$DB_DB = 'test';
$WEBADMIN_PASS = "password";
</pre>

(you may also want to change the time zone in the code just below it.)
<br><br>

You can then login to the admin.php page and create your first user account. The UserID generated by the web app will be the userid you
use when you configure your arduino software. You can specify any apikey you want. 
<br><br>

<b>Do NOT use a super secret password because it will be sent in cleartext over the web</b>
