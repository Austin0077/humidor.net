The easiest way to get started is to make use of the free hosting on SandSprite.com, all you have to do
is contact me to get a user ID and API key that you can use. you can email me at
<a href="mailto:dzzie@yahoo.com?subject=IoT%20Account%20Setup&body=Hi%20Please%20create%20an%20account%20for%20me" target=_blank>dzzie@yahoo.com</a>
<br><br>

If you take this option, you can skip all of the information below and go straight on to the software page.
<br><br>

if you would like to host your own server on your local network then the easiest way to do it
is to install <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/" target=_blank>Wamp Server</a> which comes with everything you need.
You can also use your own internet hosting provider. If you store your data locally on your own network , then it will not be
available while you are on the road.
<br><br>

once you have a working server to use the first step is to put the files from <b>/web_root</b> into the servers web root directory. Next
you will need to import the database structure found in the <b>humidor.sql</b> file
from the <a href="https://github.com/dzzie/humidor.net">GIT repository.</a> You can use the PHP MyAdmin
tool to do this. (It is included with WAMP and most web host control panels). In the web scripts, the default database name is test.
<br><br>

Depending on your settings, you may need to edit the <b>functions.php</b> web page to match your server. 
There are some variables listed at the top of this document in the "public config block":

<pre>
$DB_IP = '127.0.0.1';         //database server ip address
$DB_USER = 'root';            //db server user
$DB_PASS = '';                //db server password
$DB_DB = 'test';              //database name that humidor.sql structure can be found in
$WEBADMIN_PASS = "password";  //password for the webadmin panel to add new users
</pre>

(you may also want to change the time zone in the code just below it.)
<br><br>

You can then login to the <b>admin.php</b> page and create your first user account. The UserID generated by the web app will be the userid you
use when you configure your arduino software. You can specify any apikey you want. 
<br><br>

<b>Do NOT use a super secret password because it will be sent in cleartext over the web</b>

<br><br>
If you want to be able to receive email alerts, you will also have to setup an email server. I do not have a recommendation for one to use
locally. I only use WAMP and a local setup for testing then upload to my web hosting account. Hosting a local email server may not be reliable.
Some email servers will not accept the mail because it has a high liklihood of being spam when not coming from a known public email service or
domain. Your milage will vary. You can purchase a web hosted domain for around $7 per month, or again, contact me for a free account on mine.
