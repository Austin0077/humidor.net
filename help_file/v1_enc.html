creating an enclosure for the Arduino is an optional step that can give it a more professional look
and safeguard the components against accidental static electricity discharges or physical damage.

creating an enclosure for the Arduino is actually the hardest part of this whole project. 
Trying to line the buttons up is a little tricky. 
<br><br>

I will have a couple more notes on creating an enclosure on the advanced page for now I will just leave you
with a few pictures of how I designed mine.
