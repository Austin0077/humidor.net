<div style="width:600">
creating an enclosure for the Arduino is an optional step that can give it a more professional look
and safeguard the components against accidental static electricity discharges or physical damage.
<br><br>

creating an enclosure for the Arduino can be the hardest part of this whole project. 
Trying to line the buttons up is more trouble than its worth. I would recommend just taking the easy way
out and soldering in wires and larger push buttons that can be easily mounted to the case whereever you desire.
<br><br>

In my build i spent allot of time lining up these small metal plugs to the tiny buttons on the lcd shield.
Its an awkward placement, they hurt to press, and were very fussy to line up right. If you are going to use
the smoke/water buttons, its totally worth another $5 to buy some physical buttons you can screw into the case.
<br><br>

Anyway I will just leave you with a few pictures of how I designed mine.
