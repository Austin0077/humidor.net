	This project is an internet-enabled humidor built from readily available, easily assembled parts. 
	You can see a <a href="http://sandsprite.com/humidor/index.php?id=6">live feed here</a> of it in action.
	<br><br>
	This project has been designed to be able to be completed within 1-2 hours by someone with basic computer skills
	a soldering iron, and a little bit of patience to learn some new tricks.
 	<br><br>

    If you are unsure about your electronic skills I am sure that you could find a local 15-year-old who is into computers and would 
	be happy to complete the project for a pizza. I have even seen listings on craigs list for people who would help out with this
	type of work for a small fee.

	The humidor uses a small computer called and Arduino to upload the temperature and humidity to a Web server every 30 minutes.
	<br><br>
	
	If the Humidor requires maintenance the Web server will send the user an email alert to help them protect their investment.
	The web server records the data to a database, and can present the user with the graphs of its fluctuations over time.
	<br><br>
	
	You can also choose to record events such as when the humidor is watered or when you have a smoke. These will be displayed
	on the website.
	<br><br>
		
	A Windows phone application is also available that puts this information at your fingertips no matter where you are
	in the world. 
	<br><br>
	The hardware will cost about $100, and all of the software is free.
	<br><br>
	I hope you enjoy using this project as much as I have had in creating it. I have wanted this for a long time and thought that I would share it 
	with my other brothers of the leaf.
	<br><br>
