I enjoy sharing my passions with the world, creating new tools and inventions that
make it a better place. I also enjoy teaching others new tricks and enabling them to do 
things they didnt know how to before. 
<br><br>

I have spent allot of time on this project, and hope that you have found it useful.
<br><br>

If you would like to make a donation as a token of appreciation for the time I have spent,
you can paypal dzzie@yahoo.com 
<br><br>

Knowing that other people value the work I share helps encourage me to keep releasing new
projects, tutorials, videos, and tools.
