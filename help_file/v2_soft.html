<div style="width:600">

now that you have your hardware, and a UserID + API key from the Web server section, now it is time to upload the code to the Arduino.
<br><br>

to do this you will have to download and install <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases" target=_blank>the Arduino software</a>.
I would recommend using a slightly older 1.5.x installer, which adafruit recommends for use with the WiFi library.
They have downloads available for windows, Macintosh, and Linux.
<br><br>

Also make sure you have downloaded the <a href="https://github.com/dzzie/humidor.net/archive/master.zip" target=_blank>latest IoT humidor source</a>.
<br><br>

first you must install the Arduino libraries from the folder <b>/Arduino/libraries/</b> to your local /libraries/ folder in the root of your Arduino
installation directory. Literally this is just a copy and paste operation.
<br><br>

The source code for the version 2 touch screen project are in the /Arduino/tft folder.
There are no source code modifications required for the version 2 build. Open the tft.ino file, connect your arduino to the PC using the USB cable, and
upload the code.
<br><br>

All of the settings for this build are stored on an SD card. Copy the files from the /tft/SDCard_Files folder onto your Micro SD card.
Open public.ini, edit it with your settings, and then save it as private.ini. Thats it!
<br><br>

An example file is below:
<br><br>

<pre>
# edit this file and save as private.ini
# place a copy of it in the root of your sdcard
# valid values for security = wep, none, wpa, wpa2
# note wep keys must be valid hex chars lowercase only! 

[wifi]
ssid     = mywifiname
security = wep
pass     = baadf00d11

[config]
ext_watchdog = 1
temp_shift   = 0
humi_shift   = 2
debug_local  = 0
demoMode     = 1
speedMode    = 0

[web]
client_id = 1
apikey    = password
server    = sandsprite.com
test_ip   = 192.168.0.10
</pre>

Congrats setup is complete and you should see information start to show up on the TFT screen!
