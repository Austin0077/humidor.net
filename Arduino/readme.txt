humidor folder contains the version 1 arduino project using the 16x2 lcd
this is the original stable dev branch. total cost $100

--------------------------------------------------------------

the tft folder is version 2. I am trying to make it 
easier to build but is a little bit more expensive. Looks better 
too though..total cost $160

--------------------------------------------------------------

the low cost folder is a build that should be very simple to 
put together and only costs $40. it has no screen and no buttons 
but is only a couple wires to hookup.
